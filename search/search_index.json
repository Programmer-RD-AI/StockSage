The project aims to leverage the power of specialized AI agents to identify the top 5 US stocks with the highest potential for growth and returns. Problem Statement Selecting high-performing stocks requires analyzing vast amounts of data from diverse sources, including: Financial statements and metrics Technical indicators and price patterns Market sentiment and news Macroeconomic factors Industry trends and competitive dynamics Human analysts are limited in their ability to process this information comprehensively and objectively. StockSage addresses this challenge through a coordinated multi-agent system where each agent specializes in a specific domain of analysis. Solution Approach StockSage employs a hierarchical architecture where multiple specialized agents collaborate to perform stock analysis and selection: Data Collection Agents : Gather real-time and historical data from financial markets, news sources, and social media Analysis Agents : Process and derive insights from the collected data using specialized models Evaluation Agents : Score and rank stocks based on multiple criteria Orchestration Agent : Coordinates the workflow and synthesizes the final recommendations Key Objectives Provide data-driven stock recommendations that outperform market benchmarks Offer transparent reasoning behind each stock selection Adapt to changing market conditions and evolving investor preferences Enable customization based on investment horizons and risk profiles Target Audience Individual investors seeking data-backed investment ideas Financial advisors looking to complement their research Portfolio managers interested in systematic stock selection approaches Financial technology developers who want to build on top of StockSage's capabilities Project Scope The current version of StockSage focuses on: Top US equity markets (NYSE, NASDAQ) Daily stock selection recommendations Medium to long-term investment horizons (3-12 months) Large and mid-cap stocks with sufficient liquidity Future iterations will expand coverage to international markets, smaller capitalization stocks, and additional asset classes.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"introduction/#introduction-to-stocksage","text":"","title":"Introduction to StockSage"},{"location":"introduction/#project-overview","text":"StockSage is a sophisticated stock selection system built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework.
