# Introduction to StockSage

## Project Overview

StockSage is a sophisticated stock selection system built on a hierarchical multi-agent framework. The project aims to leverage the power of specialized AI agents to identify the top 5 US stocks with the highest potential for growth and returns.

## Problem Statement

Selecting high-performing stocks requires analyzing vast amounts of data from diverse sources, including:

- Financial statements and metrics
- Technical indicators and price patterns
- Market sentiment and news
- Macroeconomic factors
- Industry trends and competitive dynamics

Human analysts are limited in their ability to process this information comprehensively and objectively. StockSage addresses this challenge through a coordinated multi-agent system where each agent specializes in a specific domain of analysis.

## Solution Approach

StockSage employs a hierarchical architecture where multiple specialized agents collaborate to perform stock analysis and selection:

1. **Data Collection Agents**: Gather real-time and historical data from financial markets, news sources, and social media
2. **Analysis Agents**: Process and derive insights from the collected data using specialized models
3. **Evaluation Agents**: Score and rank stocks based on multiple criteria
4. **Orchestration Agent**: Coordinates the workflow and synthesizes the final recommendations

## Key Objectives

- Provide data-driven stock recommendations that outperform market benchmarks
- Offer transparent reasoning behind each stock selection
- Adapt to changing market conditions and evolving investor preferences
- Enable customization based on investment horizons and risk profiles

## Target Audience

- Individual investors seeking data-backed investment ideas
- Financial advisors looking to complement their research
- Portfolio managers interested in systematic stock selection approaches
- Financial technology developers who want to build on top of StockSage's capabilities

## Project Scope

The current version of StockSage focuses on:

- Top US equity markets (NYSE, NASDAQ)
- Daily stock selection recommendations
- Medium to long-term investment horizons (3-12 months)
- Large and mid-cap stocks with sufficient liquidity

Future iterations will expand coverage to international markets, smaller capitalization stocks, and additional asset classes.
